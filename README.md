# AI Solid Waste Detection and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on using a YOLO model for the detection and classification of solid waste items. The AI system is designed to assist in waste management by accurately identifying different types of solid waste from images, contributing to more efficient waste sorting and recycling processes.

## Key Features
- YOLO Model: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, a state-of-the-art model for real-time object detection.
- Roboflow: Roboflow is used for dataset annotation, allowing efficient image labeling and dataset management.
- Python 3.12: The project is built using Python 3.12, ensuring compatibility with modern libraries and tools.

## Setup and Installation
**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.10 or higher
- YOLO11l version compatible with the dataset and setup
- Roboflow API key for dataset management
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javaidiqbal11/AI-Solid-Waste-Detection.git
cd AI-Solid-Waste-Detection
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
