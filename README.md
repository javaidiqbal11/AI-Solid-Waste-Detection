# AI-Solid-Waste-Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on using a YOLO model for the detection and classification of solid waste items. The AI system is designed to assist in waste management by accurately identifying different types of solid waste from images, contributing to more efficient waste sorting and recycling processes.

## Key Features
- YOLO Model: Utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, a state-of-the-art model for real-time object detection.
- Roboflow: Roboflow is used for dataset annotation, allowing efficient image labeling and dataset management.
- Python 3.12: The project is built using Python 3.12, ensuring compatibility with modern libraries and tools.

## Setup and Installation
**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.12 or higher
- YOLOv8 or similar YOLO version compatible with your dataset and setup
- Roboflow API key for dataset management
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
